```lrc
[00:27.53] Dreamed I was an eskimo
[00:33.44] Frozen wind began to blow
[00:42.57] Under my boots and around my toes
[00:51.55] The frost that bit the ground below
[01:09.05] 
[00:58.49] It was a hundred degrees below zero...
[01:06.18] And my mama cried
[01:10.23] And my mama cried
[01:12.76] Nanook, a-no-no
[01:15.90] Nanook, a-no-no
[01:19.08] Don't be a naughty eskimo
[01:31.58] 
[01:25.28] Save your money, don't go to the show
[01:31.21] Well I turned around and I said oh, oh oh
[01:37.37] Well I turned around and I said oh, oh oh
[01:43.10] Well I turned around and I said ho, ho
[01:48.55] And the northern lights commenced to glow
[02:09.05] 
[01:52.54] And she said, with a tear in her eye
[01:58.55] Watch out where the huskies go,
[02:00.37] And don't you eat that yellow snow
[02:02.27] Watch out where the huskies go,
[02:03.64] And don't you eat that yellow snow
